          We are a young company based in the Great Border City of Carlisle. On our doorstep is the Scottish border country, the famous English Lake District, Galloway and the Eden Valley. We build bikes that reflect the joy of exploration and discovery, and are the very best that we can make.
        </p>
        <p>
          Titanium is the material we use for our frames. Light, strong and durable, they are made to our specifications.
          Components are sourced from specialist manufacturers from across the world making our bikes both unique and beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Titanium will never be inexpensive, but by supplying direct to you we hope to provide outstanding value with unrivalled quality.
